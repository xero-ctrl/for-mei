      <h1>HAPPY 20TH MONTHSARY BABY</h1>
      <p>my younger self wouldn't believe this when i tell her that i have finally found someone i love truly and loves me equally, you are my miracle and i will always be thankful that you came into my life to bring colors to my monochrome world. i love you so much baby, i don't think that i tell you those words enough because you deserve to hear it more often even when we fight. you are someone i want to take care of and wake up next to. i know that someday all of our toxic traits will be gone like it never existed, that we'll live a life where we just argue what movie we should watch, that's the kind of life i want to have with you someday. i also want you to know that you are beautiful, you are always beautiful to me, from the moment i laid my eyes on you and until the last moments of our world, you will always be the most beautiful girl i have laid my eyes on, also the love of my life. i hope we can work through this because even if im tired of all the arguments, i would rather fight with you than be with someone else. i love you, baby. i know that this might be little for you but i just want to try something different na way ng apology, we had our rough patch these past few days and we've been through a lot, especially you. i know that i am not the best and the perfect partner for you, but i still hope tha you won't give up on me. i love you, and i am sorry for all those times i have caused you pain throughout our entire relationship. i know that you're still mad, and you probably won't forgive me for everything, but i hope that you will let me have a second chance to build the things i have destroyed.</p>
      <p><em>- truly yours,</em></p>
